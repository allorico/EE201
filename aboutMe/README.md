# About me
## Brief Intro

Hi everyone! My name is Anthony Llorico and I am a third year majoring in ECE. My concentration is embedded systems, and it's nice to meet all of you! In all honesty I don't have a super extensive EE/CE background beyond just stuff in my classes, so rather than talk about any of that stuff, I'd rather just tell you a bit of personal stuff about me like my hobbies!

## Hobbies

### Playing Video Games 
Although I don't get nearly as much time as I used to nowadays, without a doubt one of my favorite hobbies is playing video games! If you had to ask me what my favorite game of all-time is, I'd easily have to say Pikmin, both 1 and 2. I remember being ecstatic when my dad got Pikmin 2 for me as a kid, and I have some fond memories of those games! I like a lot of other games too, but I mostly like survival/sandbox games, rougelikes, FPSs, strategy games, RPGs, and indie games!

### Watching Anime and Reading Manga
Similarly to video games, I also like watching anime and reading manga from time to time, though nowadays I don't get the chance to nearly as much :'). In all honesty though, I couldn't really tell you an all-time favorite anime of mine... But some of my favorite genres include slice-of-life, action, comedy, and even romance/rom com animes can be pretty great too!

### Baking
Aside from all the nerdy stuff I just talked about, I also like baking! It's quite the process, but the end result is always so satisfying (and pretty tasty too haha). When I first started I baked mostly cookies and breads, though nowadays I'm trying to branch more into cakes, and I wanna try to bake cakes for my friends' birthdays as practice. At least it gives me a reason to bake a cake, plus it serves as a nice lil gift for them! I'm still a total casual at baking though and just bake off of recipes. It would be cool to someday have the ability to create my own though!

### Calisthenics
I'm pretty much still a beginner when it comes to this hobby, but I'm steadily trying to train myself up to do harder and harder exercises. Someday I wanna do those cool tricks that some calisthenics enthusiasts can do and have what's basically total control over my body. But for now I'm just continuing to do body-weight exercises to eventually train myself up. Admittedly, I'm not the best when it comes to consistency, but I give it my all!

### Taekwondo
The final hobby I wanna mention is taekwondo, which has been a huge part of my life. I started in the American Taekwondo Association (ATA) when I was around 8 years old, and I currently have my 3rd degree black belt. I've also competed in numerous tournaments and won multiple state and district titles and have even competed for world championship titles. I didn't win those world championship tournaments unfortunately, but they were a good experience for me back then! I don't go to a school currently, but at times I like to train a bit here and there at home, just to keep my skills sharp a bit!

If you read everything up to this point, thanks for reading! :)
